Standing at a forest's edge as dusk creeps in, I tread a leaf-strewn path that leads to a clearing. Here, a grand oak tree stands, its branches festooned with star-like lights. Ethereal deer with glimmering coats roam nearby. A melody, both strange and familiar, fills the air, tugging at lost memories. Touching the tree, the world tilts, and suddenly I'm ascending, floating up to a starry sky that deepens from twilight to velvet night, leaving me in wonder.
